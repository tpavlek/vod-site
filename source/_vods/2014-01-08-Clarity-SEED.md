SC2CTL performs another world-first, hosting the first eSports tournament for Dogecoin!

Through community donations, the Dogecoin prizepool balooned to over one million dogecoins! At the time of playing, that
was only worth about $300, however mere weeks later, the prize of Doge increased dramatically making these winnings worth
well over $2000USD.

wow such many very starcraft.
